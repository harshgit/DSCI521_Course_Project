### DSCI521 Course Project

# Data Analysis and Interpretation

_This project is intended to provide some open-ended experience with exploring datasets for possible associations, relationships, and predictive capacities. This will then be followed up with the execution more complex and intensive analysis that prototypes the function of a potential application or underpin an empirical finding. Specifically, all projects for this course will entail the following two phases:_

1. _A topically-motivated exploration of available pre-processed datasets and providing EDA  (exploratory data analyses)._
2. _Interpreting the outcome of phase (1), the selection and execution of a more in depth analytics project, prototyping an application's function or empirical investigation._
