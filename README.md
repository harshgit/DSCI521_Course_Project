### DSCI521 Course Project

# Data Analysis and Interpretation

_This project is intended to provide some open-ended experience with exploring datasets for possible associations, relationships, and predictive capacities. This will then be followed up with the execution more complex and intensive analysis that prototypes the function of a potential application or underpin an empirical finding. Specifically, all projects for this course will entail the following two phases:_

1. _A topically-motivated exploration of available pre-processed datasets and providing EDA  (exploratory data analyses)._
2. _Interpreting the outcome of phase (1), the selection and execution of a more in depth analytics project, prototyping an application's function or empirical investigation._

### Our Topic: _School Grade Analysis_
>
> ### We will explore the area of the activities of a students of a secondary school and what attributes contribute or detract from getting good grades. Concentrating on analyzing the alcohol correlation.
>
> _Attributes in our datasets are taken from a Math course and Portuguese language course in the country of Portugal._
>
> #### We will be asking the questions in our data analysis exporation:
> - Are there any what contributing factors to a good grade?
> - Are there any what contributing factors to a low grade?
> - Does alcholhol play a part in either?
> - Are any other factors found to determine a higher/lower grade?
>
> #### Analytic tools and data-medium we will be working with:
> - CSV
>
> #### During our Exploratory Data Analysis journey we will also try to address the following points:
> - who might be interested in our analysis and why
>
> #### We will also give insight into the following journey during our analysis:
> - Context of Data found/used
> - Data preprocessing if needed
> - Our Exploratory Data Analysis
> - Our Results
> - Conclusion on our analysis
